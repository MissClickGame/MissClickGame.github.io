# MissClick

This project was developed with simplicity in mind.  The idea surfaced as I was working as a Senior Tech Counselor at [Tech Fort Greene](http://www.campfortgreene.com/techfortgreene/).  Tech Fort Greene is a summer camp focused on introducing STEM to rising second through fifth graders.  Throughout the camp, the campers experimented with various gadgets and technology.  The Makey Makey, a circuit board with six basic inputs: up, down, left, right, space, and left click, is an example of the technology used.  The Makey Makey allows for the campers to tap into their imaginations to make anything into a controller by connecting the Makey Makey onto various objects via alligator clips.  With the Makey Makey as the dedicated hardware, I developed MissClick as a simple game which uses the four basic directional inputs.  Along with the individual player's reaction time and a bit of switcharoo, MissClick challenges the player to remain focused on obtaining a new high score.   MissClick can be played by clicking [here](https://missclickgame.github.io/). Enjoy.  

## MissClick Instructions
